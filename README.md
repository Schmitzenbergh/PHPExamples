# PHPExamples
A repository with various small PHP projects that explain techniques related to the PHP courses on NHL-Stenden Hogeschool the Netherlands. 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This code is for educational purposes only.

### Prerequisites
An (X, L, M, W)AMPP installation or nginx webserver containing at least PHP 7 or higher. For the database examples a MariaDB/MySQL database is needed. 

### Installing
The following steps will get you up and runnning with the example project:
1. Clone the repository with your favourite GIT front-end or CLI in the webserver folder (E.G.: htdocs).
```
git clone https://github.com/Schmitzenbergh/PHPExamples.git
```
2. point your browser to [localhost](http://localhost) or [127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1) and navigate to the folder in which you cloned the example. If this was the root of the webserver, the folder will be `/PHPExamples`.

In the end you should have a multitude of projects containing one or more examples regarding discussed PHP topics.

## What examples are available
The following examples are available:
- Introduction into Object Oriented programming

## Contributing
We highly recommend every student to contribute examples or improvements to this repository. If you wish to do so, fork and clone the repository and add your changes in a new branch. Then make a pull request explaining what your contribution is. The website [OSSWatch](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/pullrequest) has a nice common workflow that you could use.
A common workflow for submitting a pull request with GitHub would look like this:
1. Create/Log in to your GitHub account
2. Go to the page for the code respository you want to contribute to (the “upstream”)
3. “Fork” the repository (this creates a clone to your GitHub account)
4. Create a local clone of your fork with git clone
5. Create a local branch for your changes
6. Make your changes and commit them to your local branch with git commit, ensuring to include a descriptive commit message
7. Push the branch to your GitHub fork using git push
8. Go to the page for the upstream repository go to the pull requests tab
9. Click the “New Pull Request” Button
10. Select the branch you want to submit, and write a summary of what your change explaining what it is intended to do and how it is implemented
